### Problem Representation: 

Tourist's lives may be endangered if tourism is conducted without sufficient guidance. As a result, a guide is required to accompany tourists on their excursion. This problem is solved by providing free applications that provide tourist with all necessary information via the internet and GPS. The domain we chosen is for Nepal's Tourism. This application will be used in Nepal's tourism business, which might play a significant part in the country's tourism and hospitality industries.
This navigator assists the user in planning their journey so that they may spend more time sightseeing and less time getting to their destinations. It creates a tour plan utilizing information such as the user's location, a list of locations they want to see, duration and costing.
